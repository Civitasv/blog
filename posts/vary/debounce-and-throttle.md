Just read:

- debounce: Grouping a sudden burst of events (like keystrokes) into a single one.
- throttle: Guaranteeing a constant flow of executions every X milliseconds. Like checking every 200ms your scroll position to trigger a CSS animation.
- requestAnimationFrame: a throttle alternative. When your function recalculates and renders elements on screen and you want to guarantee smooth changes or animations. Note: no IE9 support.
